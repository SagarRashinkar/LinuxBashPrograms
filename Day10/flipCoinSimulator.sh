# Prob 2) Flip Coin Simulation Problem
# This problem displays the winner Heads or Tailsi) As a Simulator start with Flipping a Coin to Display Heads or Tails as winner -
# Use ((RANDOM)) to find Heads or Tails Name the file flipCoinSimulator.sh
# ii) As a simulator, loop through Multiple times of flipping a coin and show
# number of times head and tail has won
# iii) Modify the earlier UC 2 to continue till either of them have won 21 times.
# Show if itâ€™s a Win or Tie. If Win then who won and by how much UC 3
# iv) Extend UC 3 to ensure if its tie then the game continues till the difference of
# minimum 2 points is achieved
